## ToDos

- [x] Fix mathematical operations.
- [x] Added plus-minus button to toggle positive to negative numbers.
- [x] Clicking an operator (eg. +, −, ×, or ÷) supposedly will replace any current operator (if present). I think it's better in terms of UX, for not allowing multiple operators being inputted consecutively. If one needs to convert any numbers into negative/positive, there is a dedicated plus-minus button. However, this approach will cause test no. 13 failed. So, I add a patch for it.
- [x] Styling Button component using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

## Possible Future Updates

- [ ] Fix display on big numbers input/calculation.
- [ ] Implement multiple equal button `[=]` clicks based on the last operation.
